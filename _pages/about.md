I'm a third-year master student from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangrong Wang](https://https://xiangrongwang.github.io/). My research interests include social network, recommend systems and large language models.
